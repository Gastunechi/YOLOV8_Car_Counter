# YOLOV8_Car_Counter
Automatic vehicle counting project through video, combining YOLO for detection and SORT for tracking.
This project implements an advanced computer vision solution for automatic vehicle counting in video streams. Using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection and the SORT library for object tracking, the program identifies and counts vehicles crossing a predefined line in the image. Image processing techniques with OpenCV and cvzone are used to enhance the accuracy of detections and tracking, even in complex image conditions.
